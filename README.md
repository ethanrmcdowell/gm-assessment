# GM Technical Assessment

"Youâ€™re part of a new and exciting project. You work for a major shipping company and will need to develop a front end web app for the fleet admin who owns a fleet of electric vehicles. As the fleet admin you will need to see all of your vehicles on a map and their charge levels at all times."

My goal for this application was to ensure that the two absolutely necessary pieces of information, the vehicle location and current battery, are very clearly shown at all times. I utilized a sidebar to display a summary of data while the map will always show the location of the vehicles. By clicking on the markers, you can find additional vehicle information (telephone number for the driver).
